# Coding Conventions #

We follow the public Google Coding Conventions for open-source projects:

> [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)

These rules are strict and elaborate, yet they are very good, useful, and sensible. Well, in most cases. All code must be checked against these conventions.
