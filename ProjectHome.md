## Overview ##
This project seeks to build an infrastructure for micro-architectural optimizations at the instruction level.

MAO is a stand alone tool that takes assembly code as input and translates it to an IR that optimization and analysis passes can work with. MAO can then output information/statistics about the input as well as the transformed assembly code. It reuses code from the binutils project. Please see the wiki-pages below for detailed information.

The current MAO version is a fully functioning prototype targeting x86, with big plans for the future. It is deployed in production at Google.
